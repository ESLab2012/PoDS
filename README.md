# PoDS
To improve the run-time predictability and run-time efficiency of micro-ROS, we design and implement a priority-driven chain-aware scheduling system (PoDS) based on the existing micro-ROS architecture.

For more details about PoDS, please refer to our paper : 
[Improving Real-Time Performance of Micro-ROS with Priority-Driven Chain-Aware Scheduling](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/9/1658)

For instructions on setting up micro-ROS, please refer to the official tutorial : [First Steps Tutorials
](https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/core/overview/)
